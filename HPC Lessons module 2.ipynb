    "##### Hellbender HPC System\n",
    "- **Requesting an Account:**\n",
    "  - If you're affiliated with a university that is part of the consortium, you can request an HPC account on the Hellbender system by filling out the form available at [https://request.itrss.umsystem.edu](https://request.itrss.umsystem.edu).\n",
    "  - Alternatively, if your university is new to the consortium, you should email your request to the CIMUSE team.\n",
    "- **Campus Champion:**\n",
    "  - If your university is part of the consortium, consider reaching out to your campus champion for assistance in setting up your account and getting started.\n",
